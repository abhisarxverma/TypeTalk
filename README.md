# TypeTalk 

TypeTalk is a little something I made *while still learning web development* using just **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It's simple, and it was built to scratch a personal itch.

I’m an introverted programmer—and talking in random voice channels on Discord or in meetings can be awkward (and, let’s be real, mildly terrifying). So I made this: Typetalk is nothing more than just a **simplified interface to manage talking by typing**. 

You just have to **download a simple tool** to redirect your system's generated sound to it's own mic, and **Typetalk is there for all other configurations like customizing voice, managing recently spoken texts, saving texts**.

### [👉 Try TypeTalk Webapp](http://typetalk.netlify.app)

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- **No mic? No problem.** Type what you want to say and it’ll be spoken straight into your Discord or Google Meet call.
- **Need silence around you?** If you're in a noisy café, a train, or a shared space—this sends only your typed message. No background noise.
- **Speech difficulties?** If talking out loud is hard or not an option, TypeTalk gives you a way to speak clearly with your keyboard.
- **Camera-shy? Mic-shy?** Me too. You can still participate in team meetings and say what you mean—without saying it.
- **Running on low bandwidth?** Skip the mic stream and just type it out—no mic needed, and no audio lag.

## ✨ Features

- **Type and Talk**: Press `Enter` after typing and boom—your message is spoken into the online call.  
  No mic noise. Just pure clean words.

- **Recent Messages**: See everything you recently said.  
  Forgot a brilliant point you made in the last meeting? It’s there.

- **Saved Phrases**: Save important lines for later for quick access.

- **Quick Phrases**: Need to say “Yes,” “No,” “Thanks,” or “Hello” quickly?  
  Buttons are ready. (And in future versions, you’ll be able to customize them too.)

## 🚀 Later Possibilities

- **I can turn the whole webapp to a calling platform but the main source of all talks will be typing, both in voice and video calls**

- **Translate incoming speech into another language *in real-time*.**

- **Type in one language, speak in another**

## ⚠️ Note from the Developer

I made this while I was still learning—and I’m still learning!
